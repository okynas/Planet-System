## **Built with**

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Javalin](https://javalin.io/)

## **Installation**
OS X, Linux and Windows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/okynas/Planet-System.git
```

## **Usage**
To use this project, I usually ran it inside IntelliJ. So that is one possibility. You can also run it by using gradle and gradlew daemon. 

## **Timestamp**
10 Mars 2020 - 21 Mars 2020

## **Wish list**
If I had more time or want/wanted to improve something, it would have to be the styling of the project. Since it was a school project, and the underlying task was primarily to build backend in java (javalin). I didn't fokus enough on the frontend part. Also because we had a finished stylesheet (css). 

I would also add docker to the project if I had more time.

## **License**

Distributed under the MIT license. See ``LICENSE`` for more information.
